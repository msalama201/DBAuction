### Notes :D
- There's a sql schema folder with some comments. You guys are free to update db and I'll update it as necessary. Its main purpose is the comments for reference so we can understand our db anyways.
- base.jsp can be used to create a new JSP file. It has the minimum code you need to connect to db.
